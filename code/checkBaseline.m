function keep = checkBaseline(points3D, T_current, T_old, threshold)
%checkBaseline returns if 3D point is kept or not
% input: 
% points3D: 3D points, 3xN
% T_current: translation from base frame to current camera frame, 3x1
% T_old: translation from base frame to older camera frame, 3x1
% threshold: If value below threshold, 3D point is not kept
% output: 
% keep: boolean, tells if 3D point is kept or not
