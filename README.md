# MiniProject

Main executable file that runs the pipeline: VOpipeline.m

The datasets are not included in the submission. They can be downloaded and 
stored in a folder called "datasets". The folder datasets should be placed at 
the same level as the VOpipeline.m-file and as the code folder.
The folder structure should look like this:

MiniProject 
- code
    - ...
- datasets
    - kitti00
    - malaga-urban-dataset-extract-07
    - parking
- VOpipeline.m


Run the pipeline: 
- clone the 'master' branch onto your machine
- open the file VOpipeline.m within the MiniProject folder (outside of folder "code")
- choose the dataset you want to run with the parameter "ds" 
- run the script-file 'VOpipeline.m'
