# MiniProject

Main file: VOpipeline.m

The datasets are not included in the submission. They can be downloaded and 
stored in a folder called "datasets". The folder structure should look like this:

MiniProject 
- code
    - ...
- datasets
    - kitti00
    - malaga-urban-dataset-extract-07
    - parking

Run the pipeline: 
- open the file VOpipeline.m (outside of folder "code")
- choose the dataset you want to run with the parameter "ds" 
- run the file VOpipeline.m
